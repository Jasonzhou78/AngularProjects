3:55pm set up the angular development environment by using brew package manager

(1) start GitHub desktop, create a repository on local machine and publish to GitHub.com
(2) open the folder using VS code
(3) create angular cli using `npm install -g @angular/cli`
(4) create an angular project `myfavoritecar`
(5) test if the app is up using `npm start`, check the localhost: 4200 port

17:55 when I was trying to modify my app version, there is an error saying "staging error" in github desktop thus can not commit the change. Use the command `git commit -am 'update the app version'` to successfully solved this problem.
2330 deleted the project and recreated it. Now the Github desktop works normally
